  to be my Profesion while im creating my Kingdom such as a Bussiness.
</p>

<p>Talking to be a good Programmer and wanting to be a Software Engineer. i have taken a little step when i was young
  i was sitting at my favorite desk and just typing something pretty weird such as a sentence of code. and im falling
  in love to learning code since that moment, i was struggling to find myself and giving the motivation. Once i started 
  my journey it is totally fun because i was taking a course that has interactive learning and project based learning
  where we have to write our own code then the tutor do coding by itself too and that was absolutly fun
